== Coffeescript JS Render Bug
Steps to reproduce bug

1. Rake the database and start webrick

2. Navigate to local host

3. Click "New Chicken"

4. Enter a chicken name that is less then 40 characters and click create.

5. In the server console you will see that <tt>chickens/new.html.erb </tt> is 
   rendered even though we made a javascript call.
   
6. Navigate to <tt>views/chickens</tt> and rename <tt>new.js.coffee</tt> to 
   <tt>new.js.erb</tt>

7. Attempt to create that same chicken again and receive the javascript alert.
